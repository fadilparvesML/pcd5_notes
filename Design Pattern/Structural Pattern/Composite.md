The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern used to represent objects that can be composed into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Example in the Context of an F1 Team's Car Development Structure

Imagine you are an F1 team manager looking to organize your team's car development structure. You have multiple departments, each responsible for different parts of the car, like the engine, aerodynamics, suspension, and electronics. Each department might have sub-departments or components. The Composite pattern allows you to work with the departments (composites) and their sub-departments or individual components (leaves) uniformly.

#### Step 1: Component Base Class

The base class declares common operations for both simple and complex objects of the hierarchy.

```python
class CarComponent:
    def add(self, component):
        pass

    def remove(self, component):
        pass

    def display(self, depth):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Leaf

Represents the leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.

```python
class CarLeaf(CarComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def display(self, depth):
        print("-" * depth + self.name)
```

#### Step 3: Composite

Defines behavior for components having children and stores child components.

```python
class CarComposite(CarComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []

    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)

    def remove(self, component):
        self.children.remove(component)

    def display(self, depth):
        print("-" * depth + self.name)
        for child in self.children:
            child.display(depth + 2)
```

#### Step 4: Client

The F1 team manager uses the Composite structure to manage the team's car development components.

```python
# Creating leaf objects
engine = CarLeaf("Engine")
aero = CarLeaf("Aerodynamics")
suspension = CarLeaf("Suspension")
electronics = CarLeaf("Electronics")

# Creating composite objects
car = CarComposite("Car")
powertrain = CarComposite("Powertrain")
chassis = CarComposite("Chassis")

# Building the tree structure
car.add(powertrain)
car.add(chassis)

powertrain.add(engine)
chassis.add(aero)
chassis.add(suspension)
chassis.add(electronics)

# Displaying the tree structure
car.display(1)
```

When the client (the F1 team manager) runs the code, it creates a tree structure with the complete car at the root, and then composites for powertrain and chassis, each of which has its own sub-components (leaves). The `display` method is used to print the structure in a hierarchical manner. The pattern makes it easy to add new components or remove existing ones, and it supports operations on both simple and complex objects uniformly.
