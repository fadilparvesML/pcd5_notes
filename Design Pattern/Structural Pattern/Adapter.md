The Adapter pattern, also known as the Wrapper pattern, is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class, the Adapter, which joins functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Target Interface**: This is the interface that the Client expects or wants to use.
2. **Adaptee**: This is the class that needs adapting because it has an incompatible interface.
3. **Adapter**: This is the class that adapts the interface of the Adaptee to the Target interface.

### Example in the Context of an F1 Telemetry System

Imagine you are an F1 driver, and you have a new telemetry system that you want to use. However, your car's onboard computer only understands an older version of telemetry data. The new system's interface is incompatible with the car's onboard computer. To resolve this, you can use the Adapter pattern.

#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

This is the interface your car's onboard computer can interact with.

```python
class OldTelemetryInterface:
    def get_speed_data(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: The Adaptee

This is the new telemetry system you want to use.

```python
class NewTelemetrySystem:
    def get_advanced_data(self):
        # This method provides speed data in a new format
        return {"speed": "300km/h", "temperature": "200C"}
```

#### Step 3: The Adapter

This is the class that will make the new telemetry system work with the car's onboard computer.

```python
class TelemetryAdapter(OldTelemetryInterface):
    def __init__(self, new_telemetry):
        self.new_telemetry = new_telemetry

    def get_speed_data(self):
        # Converts the new telemetry data format to the old one
        advanced_data = self.new_telemetry.get_advanced_data()
        return advanced_data["speed"]
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

As an F1 driver, you can now use the new telemetry system as if it was the old one.

```python
# The onboard computer expects the old interface
def display_speed(telemetry):
    speed_data = telemetry.get_speed_data()
    print(f"The car speed is {speed_data}")

# New telemetry system
new_telemetry = NewTelemetrySystem()

# Adapter
adapter = TelemetryAdapter(new_telemetry)

# You can now use the adapter with the onboard computer
display_speed(adapter)
```

When you run the client code, it would display the car speed using the new telemetry system, even though the onboard computer was designed to use the old telemetry interface. The adapter extracts the necessary speed data from the new system and presents it in a way that the old system expects. This is the essence of the Adapter pattern: to allow the client code to continue operating without any changes, even though the underlying systems it relies on may have changed.
