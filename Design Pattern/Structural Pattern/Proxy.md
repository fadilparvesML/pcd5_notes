The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides an object acting as a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This could be for reasons such as handling the cost of object creation, controlling the operations before or after the request gets to the underlying object, or adding a layer of security.

### Example in the Context of Accessing an F1 Racing Car's Telemetry Data

Imagine you're an F1 driver or team engineer who needs to access the car's telemetry data. However, directly accessing the telemetry data can be expensive in terms of computational resources, or you might want to enforce access control. A Proxy can be used to solve these issues.

#### Step 1: Subject Interface

This interface declares common operations for both the RealSubject and the Proxy. The RealSubject is the real object that the Proxy represents.

```python
class TelemetryDataInterface:
    def access_telemetry_data(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: RealSubject

The `RealSubject` class defines the real object that the proxy represents.

```python
class TelemetryData(TelemetryDataInterface):
    def access_telemetry_data(self):
        return "Telemetry Data: Speed, Acceleration, Tire Pressure, etc."
```

#### Step 3: Proxy

The `Proxy` class, which implements the same interface as the real object, controls access to the real object and may perform tasks such as lazy initialization, logging, access control, or caching.

```python
class TelemetryDataProxy(TelemetryDataInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        self._telemetry_data = None

    def access_telemetry_data(self):
        if self._telemetry_data is None:
            self._telemetry_data = TelemetryData()  # Lazy initialization
        print("Proxy Access Control: Data access granted.")
        return self._telemetry_data.access_telemetry_data()
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

The client interacts with the `TelemetryData` through the `TelemetryDataProxy`. The proxy can add additional behaviors like access control or caching without changing the client's code or the way the client interacts with the subject.

```python
def main():
    telemetry_data_proxy = TelemetryDataProxy()
    data = telemetry_data_proxy.access_telemetry_data()
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `TelemetryDataProxy` serves as a placeholder for `TelemetryData`. It controls access to it, potentially adding logic before or after the access to the telemetry data. This could include checking if the client has the necessary permissions, logging the access for audit purposes, or managing resource-intensive operations like creating or fetching the telemetry data only when it's absolutely necessary.

The Proxy pattern allows for the flexibility of adding a wide range of behaviors transparently to the client, making it a powerful design choice for scenarios where indirect access to objects is needed.
