The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that reduces direct communication between objects to make them less coupled, allowing you to vary their interaction independently. The mediator centralizes complex communications and control between related objects, thereby reducing the dependencies among them.

### Example: Coordinating an F1 Team's In-Race Strategy Changes

Imagine an F1 team during a race that needs to coordinate various strategy changes like tire swaps, fuel load adjustments, and wing settings based on the race's progress, weather conditions, and the driver's feedback. Direct communication between all these components can make the system complex and hard to manage. A mediator can simplify this by acting as the central point of communication.

#### Step 1: Mediator Interface

First, define a mediator interface that declares a method used by components to communicate.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class RaceStrategyMediator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def notify(self, sender, event):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Concrete Mediator

Implement the mediator that coordinates the communication between different components.

```python
class TeamStrategyMediator(RaceStrategyMediator):
    def __init__(self, pit_crew, engineer, driver):
        self.pit_crew = pit_crew
        self.engineer = engineer
        self.driver = driver

        self.pit_crew.mediator = self
        self.engineer.mediator = self
        self.driver.mediator = self

    def notify(self, sender, event):
        if event == "need_tire_change":
            print("Mediator responds to tire change request.")
            self.pit_crew.prepare_tires()
        elif event == "strategy_change":
            print("Mediator informs driver about the strategy change.")
            self.driver.acknowledge_strategy_change()
```

#### Step 3: Components

Define the components that interact with each other through the mediator.

```python
class TeamComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mediator = None

class PitCrew(TeamComponent):
    def prepare_tires(self):
        print("Pit Crew: Tires prepared.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "tires_ready")

class Engineer(TeamComponent):
    def request_tire_change(self):
        print("Engineer: Requesting tire change.")
        self.mediator.notify(self, "need_tire_change")

class Driver(TeamComponent):
    def acknowledge_strategy_change(self):
        print("Driver: Acknowledged strategy change.")
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

Set up the components and the mediator, and simulate an in-race scenario.

```python
def main():
    pit_crew = PitCrew()
    engineer = Engineer()
    driver = Driver()

    mediator = TeamStrategyMediator(pit_crew, engineer, driver)

    # Engineer requests a tire change, mediated communication handles the rest
    engineer.request_tire_change()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:

```
Engineer: Requesting tire change.
Mediator responds to tire change request.
Pit Crew: Tires prepared.
Mediator informs driver about the strategy change.
Driver: Acknowledged strategy change.
```

In this example, `TeamStrategyMediator` serves as the central communication point for the `PitCrew`, `Engineer`, and `Driver` components. Instead of these components communicating directly and needing to know about each other's methods and internal states, they interact through the mediator. This setup simplifies the dependencies between components, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
