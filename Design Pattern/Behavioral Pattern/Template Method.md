The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is particularly useful when multiple steps of an algorithm are generally the same, but some steps may require different implementations in different contexts.

### Example: F1 Car Race Simulation

Imagine you're developing a simulator for F1 car races. The overall process of completing a lap can be broken down into several steps: starting the lap, driving through various sections of the track, and finishing the lap. While the structure of completing a lap remains the same, the way a car drives through different sections of the track can vary depending on the car's specifications or the driver's style.

#### Step 1: Abstract Class with the Template Method

Define an abstract class that outlines the template method and the steps of the algorithm.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class RaceLapSimulator(ABC):
    # Template method
    def complete_lap(self):
        self.start_lap()
        self.drive_straight()
        self.drive_turn()
        self.finish_lap()

    def start_lap(self):
        print("Starting the lap.")

    @abstractmethod
    def drive_straight(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def drive_turn(self):
        pass

    def finish_lap(self):
        print("Finishing the lap.")
```

#### Step 2: Concrete Implementations

Subclasses override the abstract steps defined in the superclass.

```python
class AggressiveDriverSimulator(RaceLapSimulator):
    def drive_straight(self):
        print("Driving straight: Full throttle, maximizing speed.")

    def drive_turn(self):
        print("Driving turn: Late braking, aggressive cornering.")

class DefensiveDriverSimulator(RaceLapSimulator):
    def drive_straight(self):
        print("Driving straight: Conserving fuel, maintaining speed.")

    def drive_turn(self):
        print("Driving turn: Early braking, smooth cornering.")
```

#### Step 3: Client Code

The client code can now use these concrete implementations to simulate a lap with different driving styles.

```python
def simulate_lap(driver_simulator: RaceLapSimulator):
    driver_simulator.complete_lap()

# Simulation with an aggressive driving style
print("Aggressive Driving Simulation:")
simulate_lap(AggressiveDriverSimulator())

# Simulation with a defensive driving style
print("\nDefensive Driving Simulation:")
simulate_lap(DefensiveDriverSimulator())
```

Output:

```
Aggressive Driving Simulation:
Starting the lap.
Driving straight: Full throttle, maximizing speed.
Driving turn: Late braking, aggressive cornering.
Finishing the lap.

Defensive Driving Simulation:
Starting the lap.
Driving straight: Conserving fuel, maintaining speed.
Driving turn: Early braking, smooth cornering.
Finishing the lap.
```

In this example, the `RaceLapSimulator` class defines the template method `complete_lap`, which outlines the steps to complete a lap in the race. Concrete classes like `AggressiveDriverSimulator` and `DefensiveDriverSimulator` provide specific implementations for the steps that vary (like driving through straights and turns). This structure allows the overall algorithm to stay consistent while enabling flexibility in the parts of the algorithm that may vary.
