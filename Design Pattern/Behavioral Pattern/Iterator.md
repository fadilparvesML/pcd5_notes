The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It abstracts the iteration over a collection, allowing different kinds of collections to be navigated in a uniform manner.

### Example: Navigating Through an F1 Team's Garage Inventory

Imagine you're part of an F1 team, and you need to keep track of various types of equipment in your garage, such as tires, fuel cans, and tools. You want to iterate over these items without knowing the underlying structure of your inventory system.

#### Step 1: Iterator Interface

First, define an iterator interface that declares methods for traversing a collection.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Iterator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def has_next(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def next(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Aggregate Interface

Define an aggregate interface that declares a method for creating an iterator.

```python
class Aggregate(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_iterator(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 3: Concrete Aggregate

Create a concrete aggregate class that implements the aggregate interface. This class will contain the collection and return an instance of a concrete iterator to navigate through it.

```python
class GarageInventory(Aggregate):
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def create_iterator(self):
        return GarageIterator(self.items)
```

#### Step 4: Concrete Iterator

Implement the concrete iterator that manages the navigation through the aggregate collection.

```python
class GarageIterator(Iterator):
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.index = 0
        self.items = items

    def has_next(self):
        return self.index < len(self.items)

    def next(self):
        item = self.items[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return item
```

#### Step 5: Client Code

The client code uses the iterator to access elements of the collection.

```python
def main():
    inventory_items = ["Tire Set", "Fuel Can", "Tool Kit", "Spare Engine"]
    garage_inventory = GarageInventory(inventory_items)
    iterator = garage_inventory.create_iterator()

    print("Garage Inventory:")
    while iterator.has_next():
        print(iterator.next())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:

```
Garage Inventory:
Tire Set
Fuel Can
Tool Kit
Spare Engine
```

In this example, `GarageInventory` represents a collection of items in the F1 team's garage. `GarageIterator` is a concrete iterator that provides sequential access to this collection. The client code demonstrates how to use the iterator to navigate through the garage inventory without knowing how the items are stored internally. This pattern decouples the collection's internal representation and traversal mechanism, promoting flexibility and reuse.
