The Observer design pattern is a behavioral pattern used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems, where the state of one object needs to trigger actions in other objects.

### Example: Monitoring an F1 Car's Telemetry Data

Imagine you're developing a system for an F1 team to monitor the car's telemetry data in real-time. The car's telemetry system (the subject) continuously updates data such as speed, tire pressure, and engine temperature. Different parts of the team need to respond to these updates, such as the pit crew, strategy team, and driver's coach (the observers).

#### Step 1: Subject Interface

First, define a subject interface that allows observers to register, deregister, and notifies them of state changes.

```python
class TelemetrySubject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def register_observer(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def deregister_observer(self, observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify_observers(self, data):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(data)
```

#### Step 2: Concrete Subject

Implement the concrete subject that maintains the state and notifies observers about state changes.

```python
class CarTelemetry(TelemetrySubject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.telemetry_data = {}

    def update_telemetry_data(self, data):
        self.telemetry_data = data
        self.notify_observers(data)
```

#### Step 3: Observer Interface

Define an observer interface that will be implemented by all observers.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TelemetryObserver(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, data):
        pass
```

#### Step 4: Concrete Observers

Create concrete observers that react to updates from the subject.

```python
class PitCrew(TelemetryObserver):
    def update(self, data):
        if data.get("tire_pressure", 0) < 20:
            print("Pit Crew: Preparing for tire change.")

class StrategyTeam(TelemetryObserver):
    def update(self, data):
        if data.get("fuel_level", 100) < 10:
            print("Strategy Team: Adjusting fuel strategy.")

class DriverCoach(TelemetryObserver):
    def update(self, data):
        if data.get("engine_temperature", 0) > 100:
            print("Driver's Coach: Advise driver to cool the engine.")
```

#### Step 5: Client Code

Setup the telemetry system, register observers, and simulate telemetry data updates.

```python
def main():
    car_telemetry = CarTelemetry()
    car_telemetry.register_observer(PitCrew())
    car_telemetry.register_observer(StrategyTeam())
    car_telemetry.register_observer(DriverCoach())

    # Simulate receiving new telemetry data
    car_telemetry.update_telemetry_data({"tire_pressure": 18, "fuel_level": 9, "engine_temperature": 105})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:

```
Pit Crew: Preparing for tire change.
Strategy Team: Adjusting fuel strategy.
Driver's Coach: Advise driver to cool the engine.
```

In this scenario, `CarTelemetry` is the subject that notifies `PitCrew`, `StrategyTeam`, and `DriverCoach` (the observers) whenever its state changes. Each observer implements its response to the telemetry updates, allowing for a decoupled system where the car's telemetry data changes trigger specific actions across the team without hardwiring the responders to the data source.
