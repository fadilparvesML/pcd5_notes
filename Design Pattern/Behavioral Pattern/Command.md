The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

### Example: Implementing Race Strategy Commands in an F1 Team

Imagine you're part of an F1 team, and during the race, you need to adjust your strategy based on changing conditions, such as weather changes, safety cars, or the car's performance. Commands can encapsulate these strategy adjustments, allowing them to be executed at the right time or revoked if necessary.

#### Step 1: Command Interface

First, define a command interface with a method to execute the command.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class RaceStrategyCommand(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Concrete Commands

Create concrete commands that implement the `RaceStrategyCommand` interface. Each command represents a specific race strategy adjustment.

```python
class ChangeTiresCommand(RaceStrategyCommand):
    def __init__(self, car, tire_type):
        self.car = car
        self.tire_type = tire_type

    def execute(self):
        print(f"Changing tires of {self.car} to {self.tire_type}.")

class AdjustFuelStrategyCommand(RaceStrategyCommand):
    def __init__(self, car, strategy):
        self.car = car
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute(self):
        print(f"Adjusting fuel strategy of {self.car} to {self.strategy}.")
```

#### Step 3: Invoker

The Invoker is responsible for initiating commands. In an F1 race, this could be the team's race engineer.

```python
class RaceEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.commands = []

    def add_command(self, command):
        self.commands.append(command)

    def execute_commands(self):
        for command in self.commands:
            command.execute()
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

The client sets up commands with their parameters and submits them to the invoker.

```python
def main():
    # Receiver
    car = "Car #33"

    # Concrete Commands
    change_to_wet_tires = ChangeTiresCommand(car, "wet")
    adjust_to_conservative_fuel = AdjustFuelStrategyCommand(car, "conservative")

    # Invoker
    race_engineer = RaceEngineer()

    # Add and execute commands
    race_engineer.add_command(change_to_wet_tires)
    race_engineer.add_command(adjust_to_conservative_fuel)

    race_engineer.execute_commands()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:

```
Changing tires of Car #33 to wet.
Adjusting fuel strategy of Car #33 to conservative.
```

In this example, the `RaceStrategyCommand` interface defines a standard way to execute different race strategies. Concrete commands (`ChangeTiresCommand`, `AdjustFuelStrategyCommand`) encapsulate all details needed to execute these adjustments on a car. The `RaceEngineer` acts as an invoker that can execute these commands based on the race's evolving context, providing flexibility and the ability to easily change or extend strategies without modifying the core race logic.
